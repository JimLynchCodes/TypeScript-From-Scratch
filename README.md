# Usage

Npm version: anything relatively new will be fine, but in general you should try to use a relatively new version!

- Install dependencies:
```
npm i
```

- Compile TypeScript src files to javascript in the `dist/` directory and run those node files.  
```
npm start
```

- Run "start" in watch mode (re-compiles and re-runs automatically when the source code or tests change).
```
npm run start:watch
```

- Run Jest unit tests.
```
npm test
```

- Run "test" in watch mode (re-compiles and re-runs automatically when the source code or tests change).
```
npm run start:watch
```

- Run tslint with the --fix flag.
```
npm run lint
```
